Created a comprehensive full-stack template to accelerate project bootstrapping. The skeleton provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications with best practices baked in.

Features a Next.js/TypeScript frontend backed by a Go application serving a GraphQL API, using PostgreSQL for persistence and Redis for caching. Fully dockerized for consistent development and deployment environments.

Designed to be opinionated enough to be useful out of the box, but flexible enough to adapt to different project requirements.

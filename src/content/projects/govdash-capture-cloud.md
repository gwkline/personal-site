Serving as lead founding engineer and product owner of the Capture Cloud, GovDash’s largest and fastest-growing product line, overseeing its transformation from an underutilized feature set to the company’s #1 driver of customer engagement and revenue.

Engineered an industry-leading ingestion pipeline with sub-5-minute latency from government data sources, coupled with personalized search and recommendation capabilities that give clients a measurable competitive edge.

Collaborate closely with marketing, sales, and customer success to align engineering priorities with business strategy, ensuring product roadmap execution directly supports growth and retention objectives.

Consistently serve as the top code contributor and lead reviewer, driving the adoption of best practices and ensuring high code quality across all products.

Led a comprehensive overhaul of both frontend and backend architectures, resulting in substantially improved scalability, maintainability, and accelerated feature rollout capabilities, dropping P90 response times from over 400ms to under 120ms.

Spearheaded a 70% reduction in CI/CD pipeline times, slashing end-to-end build, test, and deploy time from ~25 minutes to ~7 minutes, and introducing thorough unit, integration, and LLM “prompt” testing across our most critical flows.

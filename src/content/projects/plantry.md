Plantry is designed to solve the perennial "what's for dinner?" dilemma and minimize food waste through better, smarter planning.

The app enables users to plan their weekly meals, efficiently track pantry inventory, and automatically generate optimized grocery lists based on recipes and on-hand ingredients. A key feature is a robust recipe ingestion pipeline, making it easy to add new recipes from both URLs and uploaded documents, so users can seamlessly incorporate new ideas from across the web or personal files.

Currently under active development, Plantry prioritizes an intuitive, modern user experience that strives to make meal planning effortless and enjoyable rather than tedious or time-consuming.

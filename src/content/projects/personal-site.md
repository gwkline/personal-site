Designed and built as a showcase of modern web development practices. Focused on performance, accessibility, and a clean aesthetic inspired by Linear, Vercel, and Apple.

Built with TanStack Router for type-safe routing, Tailwind CSS for styling, and a component library based on Radix primitives. The site features markdown-powered writing, dark mode support, and smooth page transitions.

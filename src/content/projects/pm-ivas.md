Developed software to aid with mission recon using computer vision, using OpenCV and NumPy to intelligently and programmatically map ingested drone footage onto a 2D plane.

Wrote tooling to display drone flight statistics, using linear regression to predict information about the remaining flight time and distance.

Collaborated with Microsoft to conduct load and performance testing of the equipment developed during the project.

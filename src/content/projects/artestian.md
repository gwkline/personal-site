Built Artestian to solve a common developer pain point: the tedious setup and boilerplate required when writing tests. While it won't replace careful thought on test design, it helps you focus on what's important - ensuring your code works as expected.

The tool uses AI (supporting both OpenAI and Anthropic) along with example templates and contextual information to automatically generate test files and setup code. It supports both Typescript and Go test suites.

Features flexible configuration through JSON files, allowing you to provide test examples, context files (types, utils, constants), and customize behavior per project.
